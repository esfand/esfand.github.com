<p><a href="http://www.renaun.com/blog/">Renaun Erickson</a> wrote an <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/remoteobject_sabreamf.html">article about SabreAMF</a> on Adobe DevNet. Be sure to check it out!</p>

<p>It explains how to create AMF services and provides a class that locates servers and automatically invokes methods using SabreAMF.</p>

<h3>SabreAMF 0.4</h3>

<p>0.4 was also released (actually it was a while back, so I'm a little late with announcing). Here's the changes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Added SabreAMF_DetailException. This is an interface you can use on your exceptions. It introduces the getDetail() method, which allows you to provide more information about the exception that occured, in a way thats native for Flash and Flex.</li>
<li>
    Added SabreAMF_ClassNotFoundException, SabreAMF_UndefinedMethodException<br />
    These are default exception classes you can use in your services and provide compatibility with the exceptions ColdFusion throws</li>
  <li>Added event handlers for the classmapper, using this you can provide auto-class mapping features without knowing the classnames beforehand, here's an example:<br />
    ```
<?php

  function myClassMapper($remoteClass) {

    // this function receives a Flash/Flex class and should return 
    // the name of the corresponding PHP class or false

  }

  SabreAMF_ClassMapper::onGetLocalClass = "myClassMapper";

  // If you want to know how callbacks work, read about it here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.pseudo-types.php#language.types.callback

?>
``` </li>
  
  <li>Added an onAutenticate event to SabreAMF_CallbackServer, which provides a default way to handle authentication using Flash' setCredentials and Flex' setRemoteCredentials.</li>
  
  <li>Fixed a small PHP 5.0.x compatibility bug (no guarantees for making it work, this was just low hanging fruit)</li>
</ol>

<p>When there's a 1.0 I will work on a proper manual, explaining all the features. (or if there are volunteers to do it now ;) ).</p>

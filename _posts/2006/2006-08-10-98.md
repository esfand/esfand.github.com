<p>I just published a new version of SabreAMF, and it includes support for the flex2 messaging system. This means you can now use flex2 remoting with great ease.</p>

<p>It also includes a callback server class, which is now recommended for use with flex2. This class handles the standard AMF3 stuff like CommandMessages and translates Exceptions into ErrorMessages.</p>

<p>You can download it <a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/?p=SabreAMF&amp;a=d">here</a>.  You can find an example on how to use the CallbackServer class <a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/?p=SabreAMF&amp;a=s&amp;file=/examples/callbackserver.php">here</a>. An article on how to use this will follow shortly.</p>

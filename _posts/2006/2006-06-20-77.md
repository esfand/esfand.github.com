As promised, I will publish the code for the Meta detector.

You can use these classes to detect meta-information from a website, such as the title, rss feeds and blog api endpoints. I will probably add more features along the way, such as descriptions, keywords, dublin-core metadata and FOAF.

Here are some links:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/code/?a=d&p=MetaDetector">Here's the download.</a></li>
  <li><a href="/code/?a=s&p=MetaDetector">Browse the sourcecode</a></li>
  <li><a href="/blogdetect">Check it out live in action</a></li>
</ul>

The library requires the CURL extension to be installed. I will later on change the `HTTP_Request` class to allow fopen style and change it into a factory. The code is released under a BSD licence.

```php

// Here's how to use it

// Create the instance
$md = new Sabre_Web_MetaParser('http://www.example.org');
// Execute and dump the results
print_r($md->exec());

```

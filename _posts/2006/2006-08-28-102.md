<p>IE7 RC1 has gone <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/default.mspx">public</a>. And according to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IE Blog</a>, there were <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/22/712830.aspx"> quite a few bugfixes</a>. Kudos for that! It will take a while before we can actually drop support for IE 6, and I think this applies to the most of us, since some even still support IE5 for mac..</p>

<p>So I decided to give it a try.. Installation was a bit tricky, because it didnt complete the first time I tried it and the second time it took around 20 minutes to complete.. After the reboot it would hang when i tried starting it, but when I started it 'without add-ons' it worked. Sadly I won't be able to use it because the 'manage add-ons' is grayed out so I can't disable the troubling add-ons.. And no add-ons, means no flash..</p>

<p>I wanted to run IE 7 through the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html">acid2 test</a> and see if it would be any better than the last versions.. Here's the result (click to enlarge):</p>

<p>As you can see, although the Internet Explorer team fixed a lot of bugs, it's not quite yet near to standards... although it is a lot closer than the previous version.</p>

<p>Firefox still has some bugs too, right now the only browsers that are fully acid2-compliant are <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera 9</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a>-based browsers such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/features/browser.php">Konqueror</a>.

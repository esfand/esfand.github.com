<p>A simple guideline to install SabreAMF on your computer</p>

<p>First, check if you have all the required software on your machine, basically this is PHP 5  (preferably a recent version) and PEAR.</p>

<p>You can check if you have PEAR installed by running the pear command</p>

```
pear version
```

<p>If you had bad luck, it might also be outside your default path, for example: if you have php installed on windows in <b>C:\php5</b> you could try ```
C:\php5\pear version
```</p>

<p>If PEAR is not installed at all, follow the instructions from:
<a href="http://www.go-pear.org/manual/en/installation.getting.php">the pear manual</a>.</p>

<p>Next, download the most recent version of SabreAMF. At the point of writing this is 0.1.1498. The files can be downloaded from <a href="/code/?p=SabreAMF&a=d">http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code/?p=SabreAMF&a=d</a>
</p>

<p>Now, open op a console (CMD in windows) and go to the path where you downloaded the .tgz file. Then, type in:</p>

```
pear install SabreAMF-0.1.????.tgz
```

<p style="font-size: smaller">This should be done with administrator permissions</p>

<p>Thats all!</p>

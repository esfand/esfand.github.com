<p>Today I added a nifty tagcloud below my archives..</p>

<p>Nothing special, and I probably will have to tweak it when more tags are added, but hey.. it's something ;)</p>

<p>I also added a new url scheme for tags, for example:</p>

<p><a href="/tag/general">/tag/general</a> will give you all the posts tagged as 'general'</p>

<p>I added a simple implementation of the MetaWeblog API to my blog.. So I could use Flock to post to my blog (in fact, this post is blogged from Flock)</p>

<p>The sad thing is that I have to manually edit the post later on to add the tags.. but other than that, things seem to be working pretty well.</p>

<p>I also updated my services detector to understand relative uri's. Check <a href="/blogdetect?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rooftopsolutions.nl">it</a> out.<br/>

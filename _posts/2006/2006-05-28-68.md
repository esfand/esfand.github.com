<p>Today I added a commenting system..</p>

<p>It might still need a few tweaks in the design, but so far it seems to work well.</p>

<p>I used a 'math-problem' for a captcha. I realise this is not the definite solution, but as long not many people use a system like this, I'm safe and under the radar)</p>

<p>I still need to confirm this out myself if its true, but looking at the updates in the source it seems as if <a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/FFMpeg">FFMpeg</a> is now injecting FLV metadata in the latest svn sources.. This means we don't have to use a tool like <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/flvtool2/">FLVTool2</a> anymore after transcoding videos.
</p>

<p>Also, they decided a while ago to switch from CVS to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>.  Which is nice, because I use SubVersion for all my projects and now I can use ffmpeg as an external definiation.</p>

<p>The best news is yet to come, FFMpeg has 5 projects in <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/ffmpeg/about.html">Google's Summer of Code</a>. In this program google funds people who are willing to do open source programming for a project of choice. Among those projects is a VC-1 decoder, which allows transcoding WMV3/WMV9, an AAC decoder (AAC is heavily used in MOV/MP4 videos) and an AMR encoder/decoder (AMR is used in 3GP, 3G2).</p>

<p>Good stuff, I've been following the project for a while now and I'm happy to see its still this active.</p>

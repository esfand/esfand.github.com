<p>I needed to figure out in what order PHP shuts down, after the end of a script has been reached, so I created a small testing script. Maybe this is of use for someone else trying to google this like I tried.</p>

```php
<?php

    // Testing shutdown sequence

    function shutdown() {

        echo "register_shutdown_function\n";

    }

    register_shutdown_function('shutdown');


    class MyClass {

        function __destruct() {

           echo "Object destructor\n";

        }


    }

    function obcallback($buffer) {

        $buffer .= "Output buffer callback\n";
        return $buffer;

    }

    ob_start('obcallback');

    $myObject = new MyClass;

    function dummy() { }

    function sessionclose() {

        echo "Session close\n";

    }

    function sessionwrite() {

        echo "Session write\n";
    }

    session_set_save_handler('dummy','sessionclose','dummy','sessionwrite','dummy','dummy');

    session_start();

?>
```

<p>The output, on PHP 5.2.0 on the cli is:</p>

```
register_shutdown_function
Object destructor
Output buffer callback
Session write
Session close
```

<p>I was mostly interested in this because I wanted to work with a custom session handler. This means I can basically not use objects in combination with session handlers, unless I don't rely on $this.</p>

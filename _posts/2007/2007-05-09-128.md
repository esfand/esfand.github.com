<p>I finally started writing unittests with my code.. That should get rid after yet another bad habbit.. I started using versioning and writing docblocks a few years ago, but shamefully I never really did proper testing.</p>

<p>For a testing framework I picked <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>. My main reason for picking this was that its fully written in PHP5, it can produce some pretty good reports and the biggest reason is simply because I hear a lot of good stuff about it.</p>

<p>PHPUnit3 is <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/pocket_guide/3.0/en/index.html">well documented,</a> which is helpful. I have to say that I did have a some trouble getting started. Even though its stated clear in the manual, I just sort of had to figure out where to put the files, how big the scope of one unit test is and when to write a separate testing suite..</p>

<p>So my solution was to actually look at the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>, and watch how they did it, which was really helpful..</p>

<p>One thing seemed a bit weird to me.. You use the ->addTestSuite method when you add a unittest.. and you use the ->addTest when your adding a whole suit of tests.. Seems a little reversed.</p>

<p>The other thing was that its actually quite some effort to add suits of tests.. Every single suit needs to have a fairly complex class that needs to be repeated every time. I'm thinking of writing this with a simple xml configuration file that includes unit tests, suits and can include other xml files. It should probably also be able to add tests based on wildcards.</p>

<p>But overall, a great testing framework. Especially the code coverage report rocks (albeit a big buggy;) )</p>

<p>Today I noticed the strangest bug in PHP. Apparently there's a problem with circular dependencies and interfaces.</p>

<p>This is how the problem occurs:</p>

```php
<?php

  // this is class1.php

  require_once 'iclass.php';

  class class1 implements iclass {

  }

?>
```

```php
<?php

  // this is class2.php

  require_once 'class1.php';

  class class2 extends class1 {

  }

?>
```

```php
<?php

  // this is iclass.php

  require_once 'class2.php';

  interface iclass {

     function setSomething(class2 $object);

  }

?>
```

<p>Now, if you run class1.php, you will get the following error:</p>

```
Fatal error: Class 'class1' not found in /home/filemobile/testscript/class2.php on line 5
```

<p>I know this is not proper OOP, but its still a strange error. Normally PHP is pretty good at these weird structures ;). Weirdest thing was that it happened for me on one server, but not the other.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40875">bug marked bogus</a> for this, which is understandable. It would be great though if the PHP could somehow throw an error thats a bit more helpful =P. Its a strange error, especially since I could only reproduce it with this structure, and not with for example just 2 classes with circular dependencies.</p>

<p>Seems like there might be a chance that <a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/">FFmpeg</a> will support the proprietary FLV <a href="http://www.nellymoser.com/">Nellymoser</a> codec within the month.</p>

<p>For those of you that don't know. Nellymoser is the codec used by the flashplayer and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashmediaserver/">FMS</a> to record audio from a users' microphone. Up until now the only place where you could ever replay these streams were in the flashplayer itself, locking you into the adobe jail.</p>

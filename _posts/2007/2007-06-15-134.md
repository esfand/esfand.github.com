<p>I tend to use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> pretty much all day, mainly because its such a great tool for development. Its hard to go without tools like <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> when you're working on complex javascript applications.</p>

<p>Recently I have been more and more attracted to the feature-set of <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>. The latest gem I found was "OperaShow", which has apparently been around since the days of Opera 5 (they are on 9.2 at time of writing).</p>

<p>CSS2 defines the "projection" media-type, intended for use in presentations. Most of the same rules apply as with the "print" media-type. (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/page.html">CSS2 spec on paged media</a>).</p>

<p>My next presentation will definitely be done using Opera and completely in HTML. I'd want to invite you all out to open up or download Opera, go to their <a href="http://www.opera.com/support/tutorials/operashow/">tutorial</a> and open up the fullscreen mode (F11 on windows).</p>

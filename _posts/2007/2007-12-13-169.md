<p>Adobe <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/blazeds/">open-sourced</a> their FDS (Flex Data Services) product today, and along with it <a href="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/amf/amf3_spec_121207.pdf">published</a> the AMF3 spec (this time without NDA!).</p>

<p>FDS, re-branded as BlazeDS is available under a LGPL v3 license. In their <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/121307BlazeDS.html">press release</a> they also mention <a href="http://www.amfphp.org/">AMFPHP</a> a couple of times, which is great news for the PHP community, because it implies they are backing the open source implementations.</p>

<p>I wanted to make sure the AMF implementation in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabreamf/">SabreAMF</a> is correct, by checking out the official spec. The spec is not really helpful though. It only covers AMF3, and missing some of the details. I guess I'm going to have to reverse engineer the 122MB behemoth that is BlazeDS.</p>

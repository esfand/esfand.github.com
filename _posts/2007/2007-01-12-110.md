<p>I just discovered <a href="http://www.flyspray.org/">FlySpray</a>, which seems like a pretty nice tool for my needs. Especially the upcoming 0.99 release looks good. Since the latest stable release has a bunch of bugs and flow-problems..</p>

<p>Flyspray allows setting up multiple projects, versions, categories.. allows report-generation and can print out bug-dependency  tree's (the upcoming release is supposed to do that using SVG !</p>

<p>One of the most popular tools out there seems to be <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">BugZilla</a>, which is pretty big in terms of features, but it's plain ugly and hard to get a good overview of what you are looking at at any given point, especially for non-developers.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering.. what tool do you use? Is there anything you can recommend?</p>

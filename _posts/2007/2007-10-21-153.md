<p>I just finished work on a 1.0 beta release for SabreAMF.. These are the notable changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SabreAMF_Client now has a setEncoding method, allowing you to easily
test AMF3 services.</li>
  <li>Bugfix in AMF3 handling (the AMF3 wrapper wasn't automatically removed)</li>
  <li>Bugfix in handling of DetailExceptions</li>
  <li>Date objects coming from flash/flex are now automatically mapped to
PHP5.2's DateTime object.</li>
  <li>So yea that last one breaks backward compatibility if you already make
use of dates and bumps up the minimum PHP version to 5.2</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel compelled to run this on 5.1, here's a fake DateTime class
you can use as a replacement:</p>

```php
<?php
class DateTime {

   private $time;

   function __construct($datestring) {

      $this->time = strtotime($datestring);

   }

   function format($dateformat) {

      return date($dateformat,$this->time);

   }
}
?>
```

<p>And last, but not least.. there's now a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabreamf/">Google code project</a>. You can find the SVN repository and downloads there. There's also a bugtracker and a place where I'm going to write documentation (with your help?).</p>

<p>I'm excited about the 1.0 release. SabreAMF has been 'alpha' for almost two years. Even though it has been working fine I do get a lot of questions like "when is it going to be released?". It feels like closing a chapter =).</p>

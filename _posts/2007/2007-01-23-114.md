<p>When your working and developing on many boxes, either physical computers or SSH-ing into remote servers it can be quite cumbersome to manage all your settings..</p>

<p>So just recently I started using subversion for managing my home directory.. it works great! I can just update, and commit to the central server and I just keep an "svn update" in my .bash_profile. Always in sync!</p>

<p>And.. you get the added benefit of decentralized backups (since its checked out on multiple boxes) and you can revert to a previous version in case you screw up.</p>

<p>Among other things, the repository now contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.bash_profile</li>
  <li>.bash_rc</li>
  <li>All my VIM settings and plugins</li>
  <li>My SSH settings</li>
  <li>a public_html folder</li>
  <li>A dev folder with <i>svn:externals</i> to my most worked-on projects</li>
  <li>My .netrc</li>
  <li>A (password protected) sym-link from the dev/ to the public_html/ folder</li>
  <li>Random shit</li>
</ul>

<p>So yea, I just wanted to share this thought for people who might be dealing with the same issues.</p>

<p>We have had a whole bunch of issues with the Flash 8 uploader on OS/X in the past. Now its completely broken on leopard, but before we weren't able to do multi-file uploads because the 'onComplete' event wasn't triggered from within flash.</p>

<p>We've been using a (modified) version of <a href="http://swfupload.mammon.se/">SWFUpload</a> and also our Flash applications have had this issue..</p>

<p>Today I read on <a href="http://www.colettas.org/?p=200">The Joy of Flex-blog</a> that there's actually a really simple solution to this problem. Have your PHP (or other server-side) simply return some data. Our upload-endpoint normally always returned nothing at all, because it seemed unnecessary, but returning a small body in your HTTP response fixes the issue!</p>

<p>As you can tell, I'm excited.</p>

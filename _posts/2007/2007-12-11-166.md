<p>SabreAMF is now considered stable.. It has been tested for over a year, and no problems have been reported for a while.</p>

<p>I'm not totally sure where to go from here though; The original design goals have been met, documentation is written and it is well tested. Adding features for the sake of adding features doesn't seem like a good idea; so I guess this is where the project sort of halts..</p>

<p>I'll stick around to support and maintain it though.</p>

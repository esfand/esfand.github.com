  I did a bit of work on an alternative for <a href="http://www.php.net/serialize">serialize()</a>, written in PHP.</p>

<p>I wanted to build this as a helper class for a draft-<a href="http://evertpot.com/133">PHP-RPC</a> server. The reason I needed a custom one was because I wanted to make sure I would be able to spit out PHP4-compatible serialized data, and in the future, when its ported to PHP6, also PHP5-compatible data.</p>

<p>Some of my findings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its dead-slow, compared to the built-in version (as expected). What PHP's built in serializer could do in 0.00366 seconds, I needed 0.0948.</li>
  <li>So even though its CPU expensive, there is less memory needed for big structures, because it uses echo so it can stream it straight to the client if needed.</li>
  <li>When a property is private or protected, it really is. There's no way to grab the value. I was hoping <a href="http://php.net/oop5.reflection">Reflection</a> would have allowed me to cheat.</li>
  <li>There's no proper way to find out if two variables reference the same data. The only way is to change one of them, and see if the second also changed.</li>
  <li>I was hoping <a href="http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/classSplObjectStorage.html">SPLObjectStorage</a> would be able to give me back an index the stored object. Instead I'm looping through all the objects I got and use === to see if they are the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm starting to wonder now if its a better idea to just use serialize() and make the needed fixes with regexes and stuff, but thats an experiment for an other night.</p>

<p>For the people who might find it useful, here's the <a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code?p=PHPRPC&a=s">download and source code.</a>.</p>

<p>List of differences with PHP's serialize:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It only checks references for objects.</li>
  <li>It converts Serializable objects to strings when the target version is PHP4.</li>
  <li>It has a setting that allows you to automatically convert any object to an array or STDClass.</li>
  <li>It ignores all private and protected variables.</li>
</ol>

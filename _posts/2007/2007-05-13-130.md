<p>I'm trying to run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">vim</a> from the command line to edit database records using php.</p>

<p>However, both <a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php">passthru()</a> and <a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/function.system.php">system()</a> both seem to not assign STDIN of the process to my console. Is it possible to do this? STDERR seems fine, as I do get a "<i>Vim: Warning: Output is not to a terminal</i>".

</p>

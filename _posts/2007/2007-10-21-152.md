<p>Just started checking out PHP 5.2's DateTime object. Its great to have a 'standard object' for dates.. Lots of the frameworks out there all define their own date class, perhaps this can help creating more generic interfaces.</p>

<p>Its quite hard to find the documentation though. I'm looking for a way to create a DateTime object based on a unix time, but this seems to be the only way:</p>

```
<?phpphp

// unix time
$unix = time();

$dateTime = new DateTime(date(DATE_ATOM,$unix));

?>
```

<p>Which is a pretty nasty hack, because the <a href="http://www.php.net/strtotime">strtotime()</a>-like parsing is unnecessary because the actual date is likely stored as a number anyway..</p> 

<p><b>Update: kore pointed out the proper way to do this in the comments.</b></p>

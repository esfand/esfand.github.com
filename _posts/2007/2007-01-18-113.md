<p>Grepping is in a lot of cases a pain when your dealing with subversion directories..</p>

<p>I'm sure this doesn't cover all possible greps, but this at least works for the simple ones..</p>

```
#!/bin/sh
grep $* | grep -v ".svn"
```

<p>Call this script for example "svngrep", give it executable permissions (chmod +x svngrep) and place it in a directory thats in your PATH variable (/bin).</p>

<p>Now, use svngrep as you would normally use grep.. </p>

<p><strong>Update: The anonymous posters script is way better (the first comment)</strong></p>

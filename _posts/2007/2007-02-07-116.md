It's confirmed! I get to speak at flash in the can 2007. This is great news for me, as I wanted to speak at tech conferences for a while now.. but finally I got in.</p>

<p>Flash in the can is a flash conference held in toronto for a few years now and it is one of the most important conferences in North America. It is actually the first tech conference I attended.</p>

<p>Irony is that I'm not that much into flash.. Much of my work is related to opensource and standards-based development, but in this area you can have a religion about technology, but in practice you have to set that aside for realism and pick the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>Currently flash is simply the number one way to bring video content to the browser in both user adoption and usability. I kind of rolled into the video thing by accident, because one of my earlier clients requested a user generated video application.. That ball kind of kept on rolling and developing video-enabled web applications has been my main role ever since.</p>

<p>The title of my presentation is <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/presentation_detail.cfm?festival_id=12&presentation_id=467">Flash Video Lifecycle: From User To Delivery</a>. I will be covering uploading using flash, handling uploads using php, converting with FFMpeg and delivering video using Flash.</p>

<p>I'm very excited, and hopefully I will be able to jumpstart and inspire the people who are into this sort of thing, but don't know where to start. If your there, be sure to say hi!</p>

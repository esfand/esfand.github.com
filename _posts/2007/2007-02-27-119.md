  I'll be speaking at toronto's flash user-group <a href="http://www.flashinto.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4624">next gathering.</a>
</p>

<p>It's a bit scary, as this is my first presentation.. I'll be doing a short version (20 minutes) of my presentation at <a href="http://evertpot.com/116">FiTC</a>  about uploading, converting and distributing video using open-source components.</p>

<p>So, if you are in Toronto next Wednesday and you can't wait to see me screw up in front of an audience, or if you're just interested in the cheap beer, make sure your at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=284+College+St.,+toronto,+on,+canada&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=35.410182,82.265625&ie=UTF8&z=16&ll=43.658077,-79.401004&spn=0.007902,0.027122&om=1&iwloc=addr">Resistor Gallery</a> at Collage and Spadina. It's a little hard to find from the street, but if I recall correctly it's right next to a paint store.</p>

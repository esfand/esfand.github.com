<p>I started the process to submit PHPRPC to the major frameworks. I feel like I should submit it to all the major frameworks, so I can make sure people can use PHP-RPC regardless of their framework of choice.</p>

<p>Besides that, it might be a good way to gather feedback or critique from the pro's.</p>

<a href="http://pear.php.net/"><img src="http://evertpot.com/resources/images/posts/pearlogo.png" alt="PEAR" style="padding: 10px; float: left"/></a>
<h3>PEAR</h3>

<p>For <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> I submitted it as a new <a href="http://wiki.pear.php.net/index.php/PEAR2_Standards">PEAR2 package</a>. PEAR2 is the upcoming next major version of PEAR, and will be PHP5-only. Much of my code (seemed) to follow PEAR2 coding standards, but the approval process will tell.</p>

<p>The most interesting (or weird) change I had to make the standards to include classes from within other classes. The <a href="http://www.go-pear.org/manual/en/standards.php">old PEAR</a> standards dictate:</p>

```php
<?php
require_once 'My/Other/Class.php';

?>
```

<p>Which assumes PEAR and its packages are in the <a href="http://www.php.net/set_include_path">include_path</a>. However, <a href="http://wiki.pear.php.net/index.php/PEAR2_Standards">the standard</a> for PEAR2 is:</p>

```php
<?php
if (!class_exists( 'My_Other_Class',true )) {
     throw new Exception('Undefined class: My_Other_Class');
}
?>
```

<p>So, this means that the user of the package has to manually include all the dependencies. There is also an <a href="http://wiki.pear.php.net/index.php/PEAR2_Standards#Loading_all_files_at_once">allfiles.php</a> in every directory, which loads the entire package.</p>

<p>This allfiles.php is considered 'for beginners'. The wiki states that its also for opcode cache friendliness, but this is false (I submitted a bug report). So as a consequence of this all that using PEAR2 packages becomes a bit more harder to use for the following target audience: "Advanced developer, but doesn't want to trace each class' dependency tree"</p>

<a href="http://solarphp.com/"><img src="http://evertpot.com/resources/images/posts/solarlogo.jpg" alt="Solar" style="padding: 10px; float: left"/></a>
<h3>Solar Framework</h3>

<p>I opened a ticket in <a href="http://solarphp.org/wiki">Solar's trac</a> asking if its smarter to first write the Solar implementation, or first ask for approval for the contribution, because it would be good to know if  <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/">Paul M. Jones</a> hates the idea before I start.</p>

<p>Solar follows PEAR's old coding standards. The only annoyance here is that I need to prepend underscores to every private and protected property. (An idea that stems from the PHP4 era, where there was no property visibility).</p>

<a href="http://framework.zend.com/"><img src="http://evertpot.com/resources/images/posts/zendlogo.gif" alt="Zend Framework" style="padding: 10px; float: left"/></a>
<h3>Zend Framework</h3>

<p>I haven't really started with Zend yet, the coding standards seem to be nearly the exact same as the ones I use myself (except for the change from Sabre_ to Zend_), but in order to submit code to Zend, or even propose a package you have to sign a <a href="http://framework.zend.com/community/contribute">contract</a> first; which means I have to print, sign and scan their pdf. Sadly, the only type of paper we have in this house is rolling paper.</p>

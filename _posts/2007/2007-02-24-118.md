<p>I heard a few times in the past about <a href="http://swfupload.mammon.se/">SWFUpload</a> and recently I decided to try it out..</p>

<p>Basically SWFUpload is a 0x0 pixel swf that allows you to leverage Flash 8's upload mechanism through html/javascript. Not only can you let your users select multiple files to upload, it also allows you to catch the progress nicely, without a combination of nasty hacks with javascript, hidden frames and server-side callbacks.. It it  distributed under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<p>However, the integration went pretty bad.. SWFUpload is a very complete package and includes a big javascript wrapper, a bunch of examples and <a href="http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/">SWFObject</a>, which is used to embed the object in the html using javascript and examples. For some reason it didn't work for me all, I assume there was probably some collision with  my existing javascript.. and I don't really like SWFObject, as it has to my opinion overkill written all over it..</p>

<p>So, I peaked into the javascript, only to find out that just using the swf you have a lot of power already, you can specify your javascript callback functions straight from though the flashvars.. Neat! The flashvars look something like this: </p>

```html
<param name="FlashVars" value="uploadBackend=%2Fservices%2Fupload&amp;uploadStartCallback=Uploader.onStart&amp;uploadProgressCallback=Uploader.onProgress&amp;uploadCompleteCallback=Uploader.onComplete&amp;uploadCancelCallback=Uploader.onCancel&amp;uploadErrorCallback=Uploader.onError&amp;allowedFiletypes=%2A.gif%3B%2A.jpg%3B%2A.mp3&amp;allowedFilesize=204800&amp;uploadQueueCompleteCallback=Uploader.onQueueComplete" />
```

<p>Very easy to use.. The only thing I really miss is the fact that selecting files and uploading is a combined step..  Not really handy in terms of usability..</p>

<p>My feature requests:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have a separate method for selecting files before upload.</li>
  <li>Allow the ability to replace the file upload list, but also append to the list.</li>
  <li>Have the callbacks return index numbers for the files.. Right now the only unique property you get is the filename, and there could be situations where 2 files with the same name are uploaded (rare, but still..).</li>
  <li>Implement a method for canceling the upload progress.</li>
  <li>Implement a method to remove a file from the upload queue.</li>
</ol>

<p>The other problem I ran into using flash uploads are http cookie bugs.. I covered that <a href="http://evertpot.com/117">in my last post.</a></p>

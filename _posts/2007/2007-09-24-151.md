<p>And now for something completely off-topic. Which firefox extensions do you use? I'm mostly interested in the extensions that help web development in one way or another.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> - Anyone who is into web development, and not using firebug should be hit the face with a stick or something pointy.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> - If you are a web developer, you know you can't trust 90% of the other developers on the web. This extension prevents you from suffering from other peoples mistakes. As a bonus it also works like an ad-blocker. Because most ad-solutions use flash and/or javascript, you can easily block out certain domains.</li>
  <li><a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web developer toolbar</a> - Easy access to a lot of web developer tools. A lot of the features can also be achieved with Firebug, but I still like this one, because most tools are 2 clicks away.</li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.fupps.com/documents/mozilla-extensions/whatmon-mozilla-extension-for-monitoring-whatever/">Whatmon  - Monitor whatever</a>. This is a really small extension that allows you to display a status of "whatever you want". All it takes is to generate a tiny XML document and you'll have it up and running.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aesthetics</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/313">Stop or reload</a> - Merges the stop and reload button, because you never need both at the same time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4077">Growl download notification</a> - I like growl for all notification-style messages and I try to find plugins for every program it might be useful.</li>
  <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/682">History submenus</a> - For a safari-style history menu.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3692">OS/X favicon theme</a> - This firefox theme is exactly like the default firefox theme, except that it displays favicons in your bookmark toolbars, like on Windows and Linux.</li>
</ul>

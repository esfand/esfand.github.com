<p>I had to create an RSS aggregator for my job, and I had to find (or create) a good tool that sanitizes the HTML that comes in. I stumbled upon <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/">HTML purifier</a>, and I haven't seen a better tool for the job yet.</p>

<p>Some of the features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It can turn the html into valid XHTML (transitional or string)</li>
  <li>So it also balances tags out..</li>
  <li>Removes any code that could expose a security risk. (tested with <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html">RSnakes XSS cheatcheat</a>).</li>
  <li>Allows you to truncate HTML (if you don't want to show an entire post) and still results in proper HTML!</li>
</ul>

<p>So yea, if you need something similar; I'd suggest you check it out..</p>

<p>It's been crazy crazy busy at work, so sadly because of this I haven't been able to spend enough time on SabreAMF .. </p>

<p>Therefore, no new features.. just wanted to get this bugfix release out.</p>

<p>Hopefully after april, I'll be able to spend some time on my own projects again, including sabreamf..</p>

<p><b>Changes:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Changed ArrayCollection to allow pushing new items through [].</li>
  <li>Fixed a major bug in the AMF3 deserializer which would appear with multiple requests in the same http package.. (found by Kevin Koster)</li>
  <li>Fixed some PHP5.0.x compatibility problems (not a goal of the project, but this was long hanging fruit..</li>
  <li>Speed fix in SabreAMF_Server.. now using file_get_contents instead of fopen.. (found by Develar)</li>
  <li>Major speed improvements in the AMF3 deserializer.. This patch also came from Develar (thanks a lot for this one!).</li>
</ol>

<p>Downloads can be found <a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/code?p=SabreAMF&a=d">here</a>.</p>

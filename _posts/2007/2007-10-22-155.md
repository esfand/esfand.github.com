<p>Finally I managed to get some time to whip up a central place for SabreAMF documentation.<p>

<p>All in google code. I have to say I didn't really like their wiki too much.. its a bit minimal on syntax and differs from dokuwiki syntax, which I'm used to. But the goal is more important here; centralization of the SabreAMF project.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabreamf/wiki/FAQ">FAQ</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabreamf/w/list">All other docs</a></li>
</ul>

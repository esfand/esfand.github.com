<p>If you're a PHP developer, you'll likely often need to open up php.net to find out the [the order of ;)] arguments for a function.</p>

<p>Generally i just type, php.net/functionname, but if you want to save 4 more keystrokes you can easily add a quick search. Just open up your bookmarks (or places if you're on FF3). And add a new bookmark to the Quick Searches folder.</p>

<img src="http://evertpot.com/resources/images/posts/phpquicksearch.png" alt="PHP quicksearch" /><br />

<p>Use 'php' in the keyword field, and for the url, use:</p>

```
http://www.php.net/search.php?show=quickref&pattern=%s
```

<p>Now, you can simply type <strong>php in_array</strong> in your address bar, and you can find out if the needle or the haystack comes first.</p>

<p>
  <i>p.s.: similarly, the 'slang' quicksearch has helped me adjust to north america a lot ;)</i><br />
  <i>p.p.s.: lovin' the firefox 3 experience on beta, can't wait for all the extensions to work..</i>

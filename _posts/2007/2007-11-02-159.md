<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> gets <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">MemCached</a> UDF's (user defined functions).</p>

<p>This was <a href="http://lists.danga.com/pipermail/memcached/2007-October/005626.html">mentioned</a> by Patrick Galbraith on the MemCached mailing lit yesterday. This is amazing news, as this will allow you to update or invalidate cache entries from within MySQL using a trigger. This reduces the complexities of cache invalidations by a huge extent. Its unclear if this is part of the MemCached project or a separate project.</p>

<p>Can't wait!</p>

<p>Updating the keybindings again for the terminal did the track. I now have working home, end, page-up and page-down keys.</p>

<p>If you don't feel like messing around with the settings, you can download my settings here:</p>

<p><a href="/resources/Evert.terminal">Evert.terminal</a></p>

<p>It also makes it black on white, and a bit of transparency; if you don't like that, you can always put that back to normal. The old behaviour of the mentioned keys can be used by pressing shift along with the key.</p>

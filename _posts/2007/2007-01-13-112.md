<p>Wow, thats a relieve.. I switched to os/x 4 months ago, and everything is just great..</p>

<p>I must say, I needed a little bit time too get used to most of the things <a href="http://shiflett.org/archive/196">shiflet mentions</a>. But after a few weeks, most of the annoyances he mentions are actually quite intuitive. Except not being able to tab to comboboxes, that is!</p>

<p>My biggest issue has been not being able to use 'end' and 'home' as usual.. especially when your ssh-ing into a linux box (I spend at least 75% of time on a given day on remote linux boxes) this is really annoying..</p>

<p>I actually got used to that after a while.. But now! I found the solution to this problem; and it can be found <a href="http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/gnu_developement_under_mac_os_x/">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Next goal: getting page-up/page-down to work in a remote vim window as expected.</p>

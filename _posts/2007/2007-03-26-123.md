<p>This is for the googlers who might run into the same problem as me.. </p>

<p>If you try to use ExternalInterface, your flash object should not be a in a html <form> tag.. If that is the case, ExternalInterface will not work at all!</p>

<p>I had a hard time figuring this out, until I stumbled upon a comment in the <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/8/main/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=LiveDocs_Parts&file=00002200.html">LiveDocs</a>.

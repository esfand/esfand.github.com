<p>Aahh my site was down for 2 days .. Forgot to pay the bill  for the domain! I moved to Toronto a while back, and I guess the bills have been sent to my old address..</p>

<p>Well, thanks <a href="http://www.uniserver.nl/">uniserver</a>, for being patient and put it back up as fast as you did..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fitc.ca/video/2007/Toronto/">FITC presentation videos</a> are online, including mine. Its the first time I actually watch it. It's a bit creepy to see myself, but I guess it went fine. I couldn't get a mic hooked up at the time, so the audio quality is a bit crappy.</p>

<p>I also notice that I made a bunch of mistakes related to embedding swf's, which I only found out later.</p>

<p>A funny fact: The girl sitting right in the front (and leaves after a while) is now my girlfriend. So we actually have video footage of when we first met :).</p>

<p>I've been asked a bunch of times what's gonna happen with <a href="http://www.osflash.org/sabreamf">SabreAMF</a>.</p>

<p>The thing is, the goals of SabreAMF were a lean AMF-parsing library without any pre-cooked frameworks like <a href="http://www.amfphp.org/">AMFPHP</a> or <a href="http://www.themidnightcoders.com/weborb/php/">WebOrb</a>. What I mean with that is that both of those products force you to structure your service classes in a specific way, whereas I needed to fit an Flash Remoting library in existing business logic for webservice.</p>

<p>I feel like I have succeeded in that goal. It has became what I wanted it to be, it's in use at a few high-traffic sites and no bug reports have came in in the last 4 months.</p>

<h3>So what's next?</h3>

<p>The next step is to put the version number on 1.0 and freeze the codebase, unless new bug reports come in. In the meanwhile I have been working on a more complete web service framework, that will make use of SabreAMF, and will actually looks more like AMFPHP's approach. I have to work out copyright issues before I can promise it will get open sourced, but I have a good feeling about it.</p>

<h3>Features/Ideas:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Service-classes are specified using an xml file.</li>
  <li>Services are accessible using AMF, JSON, XML-RPC, SOAP, REST and PHP-RPC.</li>
  <li>VO-Classmapping configuration for Actionscript 2, Actionscript 3, SOAP and PHP-RPC.</li>
  <li>Automatic self-documentation using Reflection and PHP docblocks.</li>
  <li>Proxy-service classes, allowing you to proxy external webservices. (this allows you to access SOAP services using PHP-RPC, XML-RPC services using AMF, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone thinks this is not a bad idea, and willing to contribute <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>, or post a comment.</p>

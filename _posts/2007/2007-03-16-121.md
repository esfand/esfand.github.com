<p>Today I received my Chumby! Thanks goes to the people from <a href="http://www.chumby.com">Chumby industries</a> and <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/">FiTC</a>.

<p>Can't wait to play around with it.. It runs a Linux 2.4 kernel and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashlite/">Flash Lite 2.1</a>, it has a wifi connection, and from what I could quickly read, it can run stuff like an SSH daemon..</p>

<p>Looks like I got myself a yet to be defined post-st. patricks day-hangover project!</p>

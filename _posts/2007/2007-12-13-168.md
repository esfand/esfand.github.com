I recently started writing a WebDAV integration library for PHP.

WebDAV is a nasty beast for a number of reasons, but its a great tool to
integrate your existing web infrastructure with a Desktop filesystem. WebDAV
is built into every modern operating system since years, but I think the
biggest reason we haven't seen a lot of adoption is because of the difficulties
with implementing it.

I intend to make this library as easy as possible to use, without making it a
black-box-like system. Focus will not be on everything WebDAV could possibly
provide, but instead on the features that are actually supported by the
operating systems.

Implementing WebDAV will become as simple as creating an implementation of an
abstract 'Directory' and an abstract 'File' class.

I'm kind of debating on the following two questions, perhaps a smart reader can
comment on these...

<ol>
  <li>WebDAV supports custom properties, and in order to make the Server fully webdav-compliant, it should support these. I'm going to make this an optional feature, but, should this happen on:<ul>
     <li>A <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/master/lib/Sabre/DAV/IFile.php">File level</a> with a custom interface.</a></li>
     <li>Or a global 'Property manager'</li>
    </ul>
      Reason I'm asking, is because while I was working on the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/tree/master/lib/Sabre/DAV/FS">sample</a> implementation, it will not be easy to attach custom properties to physical files. Perhaps I should go for a combination of both?</li>
  <li>Same question goes for locking of files and directories. Does it make more sense to have a global Lock manager, or should this implemented on a per-file-class basis?</li>
</ol>

The project is up on [Google Code hosting][1], and I opened up a
[discussion group][2] as well. If you feel like helping out, or contributing
please drop a line there! I'll be needing people writing docs and tutorials,
testers, coders and somebody who has some designing skills (no, it's not just
a logo, we're actually going to put down something cool..). If required, you
can also [contact me directly][3].

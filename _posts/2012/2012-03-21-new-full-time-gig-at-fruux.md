<p>I've been at this for a bit, but now it's official: I'm now based in Münster, and working at <a href="https://fruux.com/">fruux</a> as a co-founder / tech-lead.</p>

<p>The feeling of having this amount of control over a product is great. We've also recently got funded from <a href="http://www.high-tech-gruenderfonds.de/">High-Tech Gründerfonds</a> and <a href="http://www.netstart-venture.de/">netSTART Venture</a> and moved into a new office so things are indeed pretty serious. We have some flexibility to focus on making a great product, in what we feel is 'the right way' (whatever that may mean). It will be an exciting time :)</p>

<p>So if you were looking at <a href="http://sabre.io/">SabreDAV</a>, and needed something way easier to use, <a href="https://fruux.com/">fruux</a> may be a good option. Regardless, for SabreDAV the future is bright too, as there will be plenty of cross-pollination.</p>

<p>Also, if you're looking for a job, or know someone who's looking: <a href="mailto:evert@fruux.com">drop me a line</a>! We're in the market for good PHP and front-end developers.</p>

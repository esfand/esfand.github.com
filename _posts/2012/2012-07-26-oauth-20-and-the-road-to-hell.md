<p>I just came across a a very interesting blog post by Eran Hammer about <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/">OAuth 2.0, its progress and its past</a>.</p>

<p>If you're considering OAuth, it's worth a read. It also kind of reflects how I initially felt when I looked at the sea of OAuth 2-related documentation. My experience from tracking OpenID and DAV related standards is very similar. It is very, very hard for committees to create simple standards. I reckon the only way it can work, is with a trusted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life">BDFL</a>-type at the helm.</p>

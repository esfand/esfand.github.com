<p>For years I've always just assumed:</p>

```php
$baseName = basename('dir/file');
```

<p>Was just an easy way to do:</p>

```php
$file = 'dir/file';
$baseName = substr($file,strrpos($file,'/')+1);

```

<p>It turns out basename does a bit more than just splicing the string at the last slash, because it's locale aware. In my case I was dealing with a multi-byte UTF-8 string. It took me quite some time figuring out what was going on, because I was testing from the console which had the en_US.UTF-8 locale, and the bug was appearing on Apache, which defaults to the C locale.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

```php
<?php

$str = urldecode('%C3%A0fo%C3%B3');

setlocale(LC_ALL,'C');
echo urlencode(basename($str)) . "\n";

setlocale(LC_ALL,'en_US.UTF-8');
echo urlencode(basename($str)) . "\n";

?>
```

<p>Output:</p>

```
fo%C3%B3
%C3%A0fo%C3%B3
```

<p>What bugs me about this, is that there was no way for me to know basename() operates on anything else than bytes. The <a href="http://kr2.php.net/manual/en/function.basename.php">PHP manual</a> also doesn't point this out. It makes me wonder how many other string functions change behaviour based on their locale.</p>

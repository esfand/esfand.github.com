<p>It's been a long time coming, but I finally have some working CalDAV code. The server has been tested with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ical/">iCal</a> 3.0 and 4.0 (Leopard and Snow leopard), <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/">Sunbird</a> 1.0 pre-release and <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/">Evolution</a>.</p>

<p>My main goal is to create a general-purpose CalDAV library, rather than a consumer-ready server app. I'm hoping people will be able to use this library to enable CalDAV functionality in their existing applications.</p>

<p>If you're interested in hacking around or testing, you'll have to grab a copy from subversion. Full <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/caldav/">installation instructions</a> are available. Because of the alpha-stability nature of the code data-loss can occur, so beware!</p>

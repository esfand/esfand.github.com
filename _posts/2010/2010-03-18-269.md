<p>Yesterday Mozilla Labs published the <a href="http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/contacts-in-the-browser/" >Contacts</a> add-on, which I think is pretty neat. The add-on integrates your existing (Twitter, Gmail and AddressBook.app) contacts into your browser. It's pre-alpha stability, but it seems to work for me.</p> 

<p>After installing it, it allows you to use contacts in two new ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Any &lt;input type="email" /&gt; field will now auto-complete with the contacts in your list.</li>
  <li>A javascript api is added, allowing you (the developer) to pull in contacts from the user. The api is in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-contacts-api-20100121/">W3C standards track</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I love seeing these types of bite-size non-obtrusive features getting implemented in the browser.</p>

<p>The &lt;input type="email" /&gt; form element is specified in the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#e-mail-state">HTML5</a> specification, but it mostly discusses validation & sanitation. It has been supported by Opera for a while, and Safari now does too. Any old browser will also gladly accept type="email", because the behaviour for unknown types has always been to revert to type="text".</p>

<p>So the next time you're asking your users for an email address, consider using type="email", which automatically makes you future compatible when all the browsers get around implementing it.</p>

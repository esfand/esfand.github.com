<p>I just released <a href="http://sabre.io/">SabreDAV</a> version 1.0.4.</p>

<p>SabreDAV now supports <a href="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc4709.html">RFC 4709</a> through a <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/davmount/">plugin</a>. This RFC defines a standard way to tell operating system a WebDAV share should be mounted. Example code to make this work easily is included in the actual RFC document (scroll down). It is not supported by default by any operation system at the moment, so if you want to plug your own DavMount implementation for OS/X or Linux, I'll be happy to list you.</p>

<p>The other change is that releases are now also pushed to <a href="http://pearfarm.org/evert/Sabre_DAV">Pearfarm</a>. I'm still testing this so this might not end up being the official channel. If you'd like to try the new installation method, you can easily do so using:</p>

    pear channel-discover evert.pearfarm.org
    pear install evert.pearfarm.org/Sabre_DAV

<p>The <a href="http://phparch.com/c/phpa/magazine/index">January issue of PHP|Architect</a> just got published, and I'm in it!</p>

<p>I've written an apparent 5-page article about <a href="http://sabre.io/">SabreDAV</a>. The process was a lot of fun. It's definitely quite different from blogging, where quick and dirty is the rule rather than the exception. I hope I get the chance to do this again (all provided if there's another subject I feel knowledgeable enough in).</p>
 
<p>So if you get a hold of a copy, I would be very interested in your feedback! The magazine is in PDF form these days, so subscribing and downloading is quick and easy =).</p>

<p>For a while I've been pondering if it would be possible to build a free-for-all PEAR channel for everybody to submit their packages. I feel <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/">PHP classes</a> kind of missed the boat here for requiring people to register to download, and well.. basically having a design that's just hard to take serious.</p> 

<p>So since New Years, there are now 2! Yay for competition, but it's a bit sad they didn't choose to work together. I'm talking about <a href="http://pearfarm.org/">pearfarm</a> and <a href="http://pearhub.org/">pearhub.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Why PEAR packages?</h3>

<p>If you publish your next opensource project as a PEAR package on a real PEAR channel, your users will be able to install PEAR packages by simply entering something like 'pear install packagename'. PEAR packages don't actually have to come from <a href="http://pear.php.net">pear.php.net</a>, but they can be hosted by any other server.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of getting your packages from pear.php.net, is that there is a high degree of quality control, as well as solid coding standards. I do believe though that there is a different part of the market of people who don't want to go through rigorous approval process and just want to get their stuff up for others to download. Inspired by <a href="http://gemcutter.org/">Gemcutter</a>; this is where <a href="http://pearfarm.org/">pearfarm</a> and <a href="http://pearhub.org/">pearhub</a> come in.</p>

<p>As a bonus you'll get other fancy features PEAR provides, such as dependency management. You can easily make pear automatically download package A from author B if your package is downloaded.</p>

<h3>What do they have in common?</h3>

<p>Both pearfarm and pearhub are brand new, so very little packages are available. They also both seem to be a work in progress. Anybody can register for both sites and publish their packages.</p>

<h3>Differences?</h3>

<p>Pearfarm seems to be a more complete product, whereas Pearhub resembles the standard <a href="http://www.pirum-project.org/">Pirum</a>. Pearfarm also includes tools make it more easy to generate and upload your package and/or new releases. My biggest problem with Pearfarm is actually that it doesn't support OpenID. As a developer I'm surprised to see any code-related site being launched without OpenID support.</p>

<p>My pick today would be to host my packages on Pearfarm. The beauty of the PEAR system is that you don't have to choose one for downloading packages, because a package from Pearfarm can easily depend on a package from Pearhub.</p>

<h3>Host your own</h3>

<p>If you want to host your own pear channel, I can recommend <a href="http://www.pirum-project.org/">Pirum</a>. It's an extremely simple system that actually just generates static files. <a href="http://pear.chiaraquartet.net/">Chiara_PEAR_Server</a> is a more complete system, but I've found it harder to customize.</p>

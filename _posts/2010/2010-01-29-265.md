<p>According to a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/unicode-nearing-50-of-web.html">recent post</a> from the Google Blog, Unicode nearing 50% uptake on the web. A rather steep graph as well:</p>

<p>This is pretty good news. I've had the 'pleasure' of working with a number of integration project where the 3rd party was still using iso-8859-1 (aka latin-1). Usually when this is the case, its not by choice but because of their software's default settings (Browsers, MySQL, etc.). I for one hope non-unicode charsets will soon be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>One other note in the post was about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_ligature">ligatures</a>, such as &#64257; and the dutch &#307;. If this is the first time you heard about these, you might be surprised to see that you can (likely) only copy-paste &#307; as a whole, and not just the i or j. It's one unicode character, not two. It just made me wonder: what kind of software would generate these, and more importantly why?</p>

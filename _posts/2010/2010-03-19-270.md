<p>The last SabreDAV announcement I made here was 1.0.4, which happened in January. Just today I've released 1.0.9, so I figured it's time for a small update.</p>

<h3>A public demo site</h3>

<p>I've bought the sabredav.org domain, and placed a live demo on it for people to try out. Give it a shot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>url <a href="http://demo.sabredav.org/">demo.sabredav.org</a>.</p>
  <li>username: testuser</li>
  <li>password: test</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that OS/X Finder will not be able to upload files here, because it uses the Chunked Transfer Encoding, which is not supported by sourceforge's webserver <a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a>. Read more <a href="http://evertpot.com/260">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<p>There's been a number of small(ish) bugfixes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fixed fatal error when a malformed url was called.</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/issues/detail?id=19">Issue 19</a>: Better responses to HEAD requests on collections, improving compatibility with MS Office.</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/issues/detail?id=23">Issue 23</a>: Fixed Allow header, improving compatibility with Evolution.</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/issues/detail?id=21">Issue 21</a>: Typo.</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/issues/detail?id=27">Issue 27</a>: Incorrect encoding of entities in properties.</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/issues/detail?id=29">Issue 29</a>: Missing constant causing fatal error on lock requests with infinite timeouts.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there it is. You can download the latest version on <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases/">the googlecode project page</a>.</p>

<h3>CalDAV</h3>

<p>CalDAV support is going well. Currently iCal, Evolution and Lightning/Sunbird are supported. If you want to test it out, be sure to download the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases/">alpha version (1.1.x)</a>, and <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/caldav/">read the related documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>IRC</h3>

<p>I've also setup an irc channel on freenode.net. If you feel like idling somewhere new, head over to <a href="irc://freenode.net/#sabredav">#sabredav</a>.</p>

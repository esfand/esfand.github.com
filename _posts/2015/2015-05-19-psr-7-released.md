<!-- Holler from bucharest, romania!! -->

Today [PSR-7][4] got the 'accepted' state after quite a long journey. This is
the result of the hard work of many people, but in particular
[Matthew Weier O'Phinney][1] who did an amazing job herding cats with class.

Despite my [concerns][2] and my lone vote against the proposal, I'm excited
to see this become the standard. It's long overdue and it's time for PHP to
move on from its clumsy [superglobals][3]. I'm also very interested to see if
my concerns around the immutability aspect of the objects turned out to be
unfounded.

Further reading:

* [PSR-7][4].
* [Matthew's announcement][5]. 
* [PSR-7 by example][6].
* [Conduit][7], an example of a project using PSR-7.

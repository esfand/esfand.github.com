Dear readers,

As of October I'm switching things up a bit, and giving the freelance life a
shot again.

It's a bit of a scary step! If you know anyone who might need a PHP programmer
for a short or long-term project, perhaps you can consider me!

My resume is right here at: <http://evertpot.com/resume.html>. My end game is
to work regularly for a small set of recurring customers, but any step that
helps me get there is very appreciated!

Cheers,  
Evert

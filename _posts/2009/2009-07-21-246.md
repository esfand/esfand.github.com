Just released the 0.9 version of SabreDAV.

This release mainly contains bugfixes and some API changes that will
facilitate future extensions, such as ACL and CalDAV.

* [download][1].
* [Migrating from 0.8 to 0.9][2].
* [Full Changelog][3].

Although these changes might not be relevant to most people, upgrading is
recommended in order to keep a solid upgrade path. Fortunately for most people
the API breaks are minimal.

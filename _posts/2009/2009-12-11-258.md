<p>For the same <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2009/12/if_you_have_nothing.html">reasons as Mr. Asa Dotzler</a>, I'm ditching Google search for <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>.</p>

<p>Especially after looking at <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/?pli=1">"Google Dashboard"</a>, and seeing how much of their applications I'm using already, I figured it's probably not a bad idea to at least spread my personal information among a couple evil corporate entities rather than just one.</p>

<p>The first things I'm noticing about Bing is that it appears to give much higher precedence to recently updated pages. It also seems to adhere to the Accept-Language header, which means I don't have to weed through Korean interfaces to switch back to english.</p>

<p>If you don't hear back from me, I'm either a happy user or completely forgot and unknowingly switched back to google.</p>

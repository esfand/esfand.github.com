After lots of testing, coding and integrating SabreDAV in a few systems,
SabreDAV has reached 1.0.

What's that?
------------

For those of you randomly stumbling on this blog, SabreDAV is a tool I've been
working on to allow easy integration of PHP and WebDAV. While looking at
WebDAV implementions out there for PHP, there weren't really any
standards-compliant and flexible solutions out there, so I decided to write my
own.

Since then it has gained some popularity, and the beta version has been tested
and implemented in a number of places. It's open source (under the BSD
license), so anybody can grab it and use it.

If you don't really know what WebDAV is, it is basically a filesystem protocol
that works on top of HTTP. By implementing WebDAV (or SabreDAV specifically)
you are able to expose your web application as if it was a filesystem to the
users. WebDAV is supported by any major operating system.

If you're interested in SabreDAV, check out the [example][1], or [tutorial][2].

Changes
-------

The last round of changes since 0.12.1 are mostly cleanups, but the most
important are the following:

* [SimpleDirectory class][3]
* Authentication plugin is no longer included. The plugin was not yet
  production ready, and in order to allow myself to make API changes, I needed
  to remove it for 1.0. This _does not_ mean you can no longer use the
  [recommended way][4] to implement authentication.
* The unknownProperties event was removed, replaced by the `afterGetProperties`
  event ([docs<][5]).
* Addition of [more events][5] for plugin writers.
* Lots of cleaning up, unittests.

[Full changelog][6] and [download][7].

Future plans
------------

Although the 1.0 version should be a bit of a milestone, the release had
actually been sitting ready for a while. So while 1.0 is cool and all, I've
already spent a great deal of time implementing [RFC 3744][8] a.k.a. ACL
extensions for WebDAV. Support for ACL will be added as a separate module in
the future.

While these changes are going on, no backwards compatibility breaking changes
should be made to the API's. For more details on the BC and versioning policy,
check [here][9].

Thanks!

It's been a lot of hard work to get here, but seeing some uptake is very
rewarding. I would probably have given up on this if it weren't for the people
asking questions, making suggestions and filing reports. Thanks for that, it
makes it worth it!

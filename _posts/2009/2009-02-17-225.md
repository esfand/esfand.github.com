I just finished up a new release of SabreDAV. The [mailing list][1] is getting
some traction, and it's shows! There were quite a bit of suggestions and
patches recently, so the changelog is relatively big. The best thing that can
happen is of course people liking and using it, and it makes me also more
excited to work on it :).

Most notable changes
--------------------

* *Added:* We're now using streams for passing contents of files around
  everywhere. Not only is this a big speed improvement, but it also reduces
  memory consumption quite a bit for larger files. It should be noted that this
  breaks API compatibility as the ->put and ->createFile methods will now no
  longer receive strings.
* *Added:* [HTTP Digest][3] authentication helper.
* *Added:* Support for HTTP Range header, ETags and overriding default
  Content-Type.
* *Added:* 49 unittests.
* *Updated:* Using Clark notation for serializing custom properties. If you
  use custom properties this affects you, because properties are no longer
  serialized as http://namespace#tagName, but {http://namespace}tagName.
* *Removed:* SabreDAV is no longer distributed as a pear package. The main
  reason for this is that I had too much trouble figuring out how it works. I
  use [phing][4] as my build-tool, and although there's some good integration
  points with pear packaging, I couldn't get it to do what I wanted. So now
  it's a regular gzip tarball.
* Bugfixes!

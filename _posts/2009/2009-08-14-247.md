<p>I've been following OpenID development since the early days, but in recent years the number of standards and acronyms have been steadily growing.</p>

<p>Back when OpenID was 1.*, things seemed pretty simple. The only existing (optional) dependency was on YADIS, which served as a discovery mechanism.</p>

<p>OpenID 2.0 depends on XRI.

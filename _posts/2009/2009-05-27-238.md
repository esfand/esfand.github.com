<p>I just realized I've been blogging for 3 years now, so it's time for my annual meta-blogging post :).</p>

<p>I've managed to come up with 50 mildly interesting topics since the 2 year mark, so that's pretty close to a 1 post per week average. Not bad, but a drop of 4 posts since the last.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for reading, I'm always really happy to see people linking or dropping comments, if there's any improvements I can make in my writing definitely let me know.</p>

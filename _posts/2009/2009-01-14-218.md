A new year, a new SabreDAV. This version adds some new features and fixes some
bugs.

SabreDAV is a library, intended to easily create WebDAV frontends for existing
PHP applications. [At the office][1] we're using it to access certain parts of
our web application directly from our filesystem.

[Download it here][5].

Most notable changes
--------------------


* *Added:*  a [simple example][3] for implementing a mapping to PHP file
  streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a WebDAV to FTP
  proxy.
* *Added:* [HTTP Basic Authentication helper class][4].
* *Updated:* Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements are
  removed from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of
  classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made to
  allow easier integration into applications not using this standard inclusion
  model.

* [Full Changelog][5].

<p>I just released a new version of SabreDAV, 0.12. I've skipped on posting for the last few versions, because I didn't want to get too spammy on this blog.</p>

<p>These were mostly bugfixes, and a few added features. SabreDAV is also a PEAR-package again, so installing is as simple as 'pear install SabreDAV-0.12.0.tgz'.</p>

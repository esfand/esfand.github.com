<p>I'm changing jobs! Well, at the very least I'm leaving Filemobile.</p>

<p>It was for this job I moved from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=hilversum,+nl&sll=43.670233,-79.386755&sspn=0.516538,1.235962&ie=UTF8&ll=52.227799,5.171127&spn=0.218705,0.617981&z=11&iwloc=A">Hilversum, the Netherlands</a> to Toronto, Canada. A very scary move for me at the time, but it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life. I've ramped up my English, and went through the entire process of working out an idea to a successful company. As an owner I'll definitely still stay involved though, just no longer full-time.</p>

<p>Although moving to a new country can be intense, it would have been a lot more difficult if it wasn't for my co-workers, who've acted as both my friends and family. I doubt I'll find a work environment as fun as Filemobile. (If you live around toronto, they are <a href="http://www.filemobile.net/talent">looking</a> for smart people!).</p>

<p>But after 3 years, it's time for something new. I'm excited to move somewhere else again, but haven't yet figured out the next step in my career path. If you have any advice or looking for someone with web development skills, definitely <a href="/contact">let me know!</a> (<a href="http://evertpot.com/resources/evert-jun-2009.pdf">resume</a>). I'll be available for contract work, and I'll relocate wherever you are, if needed :).</p>

I just released v0.8 of the [SabreDAV][1] library. This is mostly a bugfix
release, and fixes some compatibility problems with both Windows Vista and
adds support for [Netdrive][2].

Netdrive is free for home-use and is an alternative for the built-in clients
from Windows XP or Vista. **Do not** use it if it's more than 1 person
accessing data from a webdav share, I can not stress this enough.. If it's
just you, you'll find it works much smoother than the built-in client.

Compatibility break
-------------------

All exception classnames are renamed. They follow
`Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound`, instead of the
`Sabre_DAV_FileNotFoundException` convention. This change was made for
consistency reasons. If you implemented anything custom, you will probably run
into this while upgrading.

Future
------

It's pretty close to being feature-complete, so unless I really missed
something or more bugs will be found this will probably move quickly towards
1.0. Thanks for the support and using it!

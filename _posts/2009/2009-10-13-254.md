<p>I just accidentally deleted all comments made on this blog.</p>

<p>This blog is homegrown and hand-made. It has a very simple spamfilter that catches most spam comments. The few that make it through though, I've been deleting myself using the mysql console.</p>

<p>I tend to write simple queries, ending in: <strong>.. AND id = 1234</strong>, but today I forgot the <strong>id =</strong>. I had a backup from October 2008, so some old comments are back now, but I'm still pretty sad.</p>

<p>Lesson from today: make backups! I'm pretty good with things I do for clients, but I tend to not uphold the same standards for my own projects.</p>

<p>I was stumped, I was trying to hook up a second computer on the internet through ethernet. Normally it's easy enough to just turn on internet sharing. It turns out OS/X always uses 192.168.2.*, which happened to be in the same subnet as the WiFi network.</p>

<p>OS/X provides no way to change this as far as I could tell. Thankfully I was able to change the router's settings.
 If you ever get into this situation and you're not able to make this change, <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050331194834746&query=internet%2Bsharing">here's</a> a simple guide to setup internet sharing using the console.</p>

Just released 0.7 of the SabreDAV library. This release implements some of the
more obscure WebDAV features, and a plugin system.

Some changes:

* Basic [plugin system][1].
* Comes with a plugin to display [html indexes][2] for browsers.
* Sabre_DAV_FilterTree is now Sabre_DAV_Tree_Filter.
* Sabre_DAV_TemporaryFileFilter is now Sabre_DAV_Tree_TemporaryFileFilter.

[Full changelog][3].

Any help is greatly appreciated. I'm finding this taking up a large amount of
my free time, so anyone interested in documenting, fixing bugs, writing tests,
implementing additional webdav rfc's, making logo's definitely send a message
to the [mailing list][4].

[Download][5].

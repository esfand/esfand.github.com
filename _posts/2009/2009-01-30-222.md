I'm in the process of writing an API that relies on (file-)streams to be passed
around.

There are situations where a string instead needs to be used, and for these
purposes the [data: stream wrapper][1] is used. Initially I thought it was only
possible to encode the actual string in base64, which I didn't like because of
the added footprint.

```php
<?php

$string = "I should have really done some laundry tonight.";

$stream = fopen('data://text/plain;base64,' . base64_encode($string),'r');

echo stream_get_contents($stream);

?>
```

Quickly checking out the [rfc][2], it turns out that ';base64' can be omitted
to just pass along the raw data, which makes a lot more sense in the context of
PHP.

<p>Thankfully, PHP gladly supports it:</p>

```php
<?php

$string = "I tried, honestly!";

$stream = fopen('data://text/plain,' . $string,'r');

echo stream_get_contents($stream);

?>
```

----------------------

Just in case anyone stumbles upon this, I would no longer recommend using the
data uri for this purpose.

Since PHP 5.1 we have `php://memory` and `php://temp`. The former keeps the
entire string into memory, and the latter automatically writes to a file as
soon as the stream exceeds a certain amount of memory.

This is how you use it:

```php
<?php

$string = 'Some bad-ass string';

$stream = fopen('php://memory','r+');
fwrite($stream, $string);
rewind($stream);

echo stream_get_contents($stream);

```

A bit more info can be found on [php.net][3].

<p>While OS/X's WebDAV implementation is <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/clients/finder/">quite slow</a>, it is mostly pretty decent. The client uses the little used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding">Chunked transfer encoding</a> for PUT requests, which allows it to send big files without knowing exactly how big the file is going to be. A request like this looks like this:</p>

    PUT /image.png HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.org
    User-Agent: WebDAVFS/1.8 (01808000) Darwin/10.2.0 (i386)
    Accept: */*
    X-Expected-Entity-Length: 10316
    If: (<opaquelocktoken:44445502-c253-02e6-7198-45b36c96e8c7>)
    Connection: close
    Transfer-Encoding: Chunked

<p>While this is a perfectly legal HTTP request, webservers choke on it. Both Nginx and Lighttpd respond with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.12">HTTP 411 Length Required</a>. This would have been valid for HTTP/1.0 servers, but if they claim to support HTTP/1.1 they must accept these requests.</p>

<p>Apache + mod_php does this fine, but just recently I got a report from someone using Apache + fastcgi + php. In this case the request body never arrived in PHP which can unfortunately result in silent data loss.</p>

<p>So I guess that's a bit of a warning, so far OS/X WebDAV only plays nicely with Apache + mod_php servers.</p>

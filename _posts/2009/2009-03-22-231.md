<p>Since my <a href="http://evertpot.com/230">last post</a> I've found out that using the 'morton' number to index spatial number is also referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_(curve)">Z-order</a>.</p>

<p>To index using this order, you can use this stored function:</p>

```
CREATE FUNCTION getGeoMorton(lat DOUBLE, lng DOUBLE) RETURNS BIGINT UNSIGNED DETERMINISTIC 
BEGIN

  -- 11930464 is round(maximum value of a 32bit integer / 360 degrees) 
  
  DECLARE bit, morton, pos BIGINT UNSIGNED DEFAULT 0;  
 
  SET @lat = CAST((lat + 90) * 11930464 AS UNSIGNED);
  SET @lng = CAST((lng + 180) * 11930464 AS UNSIGNED);
  SET bit = 1;
  
  WHILE bit <= @lat || bit <= @lng DO 
    
    IF(bit & @lat) THEN SET morton = morton | ( 1 << (2 * pos + 1)); END IF;
    IF(bit & @lng) THEN SET morton = morton | ( 1 << (2 * pos)); END IF;
  
    SET pos = pos + 1;
    
    SET bit = 1 << pos;
  
  END WHILE; 
  
  RETURN morton;
END;

```

<h3>Some caveats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Since the function is using floating-point numbers, there will be rounding errors. These are generally very small, and for us well within the acceptable margin of error.</li>
  <li>More significantly, this function assumes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry">euclidean geometry</a> (i.e.: a flat surface). The earth obviously isn't, so as you get closer to the poles you might get back results from outside your rectangle, or miss results from within.</li>
  <li>It's not recommended to use this function directly in your WHERE clause. Even though the function is marked deterministic (i.e.: it will always yield the same results for the same arguments), the MySQL query optimizer currently ignored that modifier. So, set it in a temporary variable first (SET @number =) and use the variable in your where clause.</li>
  <li>Don't forget dealing with queries spanning over the -180°, 180° longitude line.</li>
  <li>Also store your actual longitude and latitude values in the DB. This function is not intended to be exact.</li>
  <li>When you do your queries, select both on the morton number, and longitude and latitude.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A better way to do it?</h3>

<p>In my research I've found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve">Hilbert Curve</a> to be an even better algorithm, but haven't yet gone through the effort of trying to express it in SQL.</p>

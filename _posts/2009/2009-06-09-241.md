<p>The LCD screen from my macbook broke a <a href="http://evertpot.com/192">while back</a>, much to my regret Apple's warranty didn't cover it at the time and was going to charge $900 for it.</p>

<p>I was pretty set on making it useful again, so a few days ago I ordered a new LCD screen myself. It was quite an undertaking to replace it, because it was needed to take the entire thing apart, top to bottom.</p>

<p>It took me 4 hours, and 12 minutes including dinner and going to the neighbours to replace a screwdriver. Here's a 12 second version of it:</p>

<p>If you plan to try this yourself, know what you're getting into.. Make sure you have a steady hand and it helps if there's someone around to hold stuff together. Make sure you get good screwdrivers and be very careful with the cabling. I also found it handy to use tweezers.</p>

<p>I got the instructions from <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/">IFixit</a>, which has some great guides.</p>

<p>After all that, I ended up with 1 screw I was unable to fit back in, a few damaged wifi antenna cables (still worked!) and I discovered a few places of broken plastic, which were likely from the first time it got damaged.</p>

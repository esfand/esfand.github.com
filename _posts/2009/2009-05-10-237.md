<p><strong>Warning: off-topic</strong></p>

<p>In case you've noticed it has been a bit quiet here, it's because I'm currently on a road trip in the US with Chris Becker. The trip is entirely baseball-themed, and the idea is to visit a baseball game in every city. So far we've been to the Toronto Blue Jays, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs and White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>

<p>We're documenting the whole trip, so if you're interested; go check out <a href="http://www.baseballchronicles.org/">baseballchronicles.org</a>.</p>

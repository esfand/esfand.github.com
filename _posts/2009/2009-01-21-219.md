  Somewhere in 2007 I had a <a href="http://evertpot.com/128">
  deep dive</a> into <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>, and there were a couple of things that bugged me. 
</p>

<p>
  Looking into it again, it turns out that since then
  everything has been fixed, making it perfect for integrating it into
  <a href="http://sabre.io/">sabredav</a>. Most of the protocol-level
  WebDAV stuff is all tested with <a href="http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/">litmus</a>,
  but having good unit tests will help ensuring a high quality of the inner business logic.
  Already it has identified 2 spelling mistakes :).
</p>



<h3>My highlights:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>No need to write 'TestSuites' anymore.</li>
  <li>A 'bootstrap' setting. This file contains all the application specific 
      logic to setup the test.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/code-coverage-analysis.html">
    Code coverage analysis</a> is perfected.</li>
  <li>The ability to specify which directories to include in the code coverage.</li>
  <li>
    As a bonus, all these settings can be specified through a single 
    <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.configuration.html">XML
    configuration file</a>. This way I can simply tell users to run 'phpunit --configuration=config.xml' and they're off..</li>
</ul>

<p>In an attempt to better understand the WebDAV standards space, I made up a non-scientific graph of all the specs and dependencies. I'd like to get started with CalDAV, but I have a few other specs to implement before I'll be able to do that.</p>

<p>The next one for me on the list is ACL. Attempting to integrate these new features within the existing system so far has proven to be very challenging. The big reason is my (perhaps high) requirements on how this is supposed to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It shouldn't touch the existing WebDAV system (at all), because 99% of the users will not use ACL.</li>
  <li>The interface & implementation should still be understandable if you <u>are</u> implementing ACL.</li>
  <li>I like the existing WebDAV class structure as it stands, so if I have to make changes in the design; it should still be easy to grasp.</li>
</ul>

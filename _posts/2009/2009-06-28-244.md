<p>9 months after the 1.2 release, I just published a long overdue release of the SabreAMF library.</p>

<p>The package mainly contains bugfixes. Upgrading is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Ionut Stoica for creating a Drupal Module, and Asbjørn Sloth Tønnesen for the bugfixes and patches. Enjoy!</p>

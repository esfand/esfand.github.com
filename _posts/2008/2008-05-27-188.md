I just put a [new release][1] for SabreDAV up.

The most significant change is that it now has a filter which intercepts
common files generated by clients and other application, including:

* OS/X resource forks (._ files)
* OS/X .DS_Store file
* Windows' desktop.ini
* Windows' Thumbs.db
* ViM-style temporary files.

This is crucial if you want to connect a WebDAV folder to for example a
database-table. This makes sure that you don't end up with for example blog
posts named .DS_Store ;). Although not completely sure, I believe SabreDAV is
unique in that sense. If there are suggestions for more common 'temporary
files', please let me know.

Full list of changes:

* [Documentation][2]
* Support for Windows XP / Vista clients
* Quota support (by implementing [Sabre_DAV_IQuota][3]).
* A standard [FilterTree][4], which can be used to intercept or change
  requests to the File-tree
* Better implementation for PropPatch.
* Support for lock-null requests.
* A [TemporaryFileFilte][5] class, which can be used to intercept the temporary
  files mentioned earlier. Just pass it a regular Sabre_DAV_ObjectTree and it
  will do its thing.

<p>Just posted a new SabreAMF version to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabreamf/">googlecode</a>, containing mostly bugfixes and a few enhancements. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabreamf/downloads/list?saved=1&ts=1221340561">download</a>). Updating is highly recommended, this release was supposed to get out a bit earlier, but I wanted to test it in a live environment for a bit first.</p>

<h3>Changes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We're now throwing an SabreAMF_InvalidAMFException instead of a generic Exception in the event on a corrupt/incorrect AMF request. (contribution by: <a href="http://lila.io/">Asbjørn Sloth Tønnesen</a>.)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the standard Recordset object (identified by 'datafirm').</li>
  <li>Fixed string reference problem occuring with multiple AMF3 bodies, identified by sylvinus and fixed with help from the <a href="http://pyamf.org/">PyAMF team</a>. Thanks guys!</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in AMF3 integer encoding. For some small ranges you would end up with the wrong integers in PHP. The integer decoder is also a lot faster now (Fixed by Kevin Martin).</li>
  <li>SabreAMF_Server now allows alternative inputs than php://input (patch by <a href="http://lila.io/">Asbjørn</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks guys!</p>

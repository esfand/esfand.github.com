<p>If you're getting a 'Commands out of sync' message after calling a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/stored-procedures.html">Stored Procedure</a> in MySQL 5+, it means there's some empty resultset in still in the resultset buffer. I'm not sure exactly why this is happening, but here's the workaround:</p>

```php
<?php

  // Assuming $connection is your MySQLI object

  while($connection->next_result()) $connection->store_result();

?>
```

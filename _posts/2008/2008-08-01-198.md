<p>The Subversion team <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/svn_1.5_releasenotes.html">released version 1.5</a> recently, with some really tight features such as changelist and merge tracking.</p>

<p>In our shop we standardized on Debian, and it's very likely going to take till 5.0 (lenny) until we get access. Normally I would just do a compile from source, but since this will have to be done on multiple servers, I decided to backport subversion from Lenny to create a nice little .deb package.</p>

<p>Here are my steps, (tested on just my machine, so please try at your own risk).</p>

<ol>
  <li>We'll start off by creating a directory for this process.<br />
  ```
mkdir subversion
```</li>

  <li>Next, download the source packages from the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/lenny/subversion">debian packages site.</a>. They're on the right.</li>

  <li>Now, unzip them.<br />
  ```
gunzip subversion_1.5.0dfsg1-4.diff.gz
tar xfvz subversion_1.5.0dfsg1.orig.tar.gz
```</li>

  <li>The first file was patch with debian specific changes, we'll need to apply this patch to the source tree.<br />
  ```
patch -p0 < subversion_1.5.0dfsg1-4.diff
```</li>

  <li>Enter the source directory<br />
  ```
cd subversion-1.5.0dfsg1/
```</li>

  <li>We'll need to change some file permissions to make this work.<br /> 
  ```
chmod 755 debian/rules
```</li>

  <li>Now we switch to the root user, because we need to install some dependencies.<br />
  ```
# Assuming you're root
apt-get build-dep subversion 
apt-get install python-all-dev libneon26-dev quilt libsasl2-dev fakeroot debhelper
```</li>

  <li>Switch back from root to your normal user.</li>

  <li>I've had some issues making creating the java hooks. To get around this, we'll need to disable them. Do this by opening the 'debian/rules' file and change the line that says 'ENABLE_JAVAHL' to no. For me this was on line 21.<br />
  ```
ENABLE_JAVAHL := no
```</li>

  <li>Now we can get started building the package.<br />
  ```
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b -d
```<br />

  <li><a href="http://xkcd.com/303/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png" alt="Compiling!" /></a></li>

  <li>If everything went well, you should have ended up with about 10 .deb packages in the directory right above the source directory. You can simply install all of them with:<br />
  ```
dpkg -i *.deb
```</li>

</ol>

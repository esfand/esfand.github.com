<p>Today on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IE blog</a> a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-v-comprehensive-protection.aspx">big announcement</a> was made regarding the upcoming security features in Internet Explorer 8.</p>

<p>Definitely check it out! Among things it includes an XSS protection filter, HTML sanitizing built straight into the scripting engine and a way to disable the infamous 'content sniffing'. I'd still hope to see the content-sniffing 'feature' to be opt-in, instead of the proposed opt-out solution.. but hey, at least it allows us to plug the hole.</p>

<p>To serve files as text/plain, serve the document with the Content-Type header as:</p>

```
Content-Type: text/plain; authoritative=true;
```

<p>I have to say, I'm quite impressed how IE is catching up with things like standards and security.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> has a pretty good <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.openid.html">OpenID</a> library. I was looking for a library written for PHP5 (strict), and this seemed like a good choice..</p>

<p>The Zend library requires a storage backend to record and cache some of the information, and it was very easy to implement a custom one for our database layer. There's a bunch of good examples are available on the documentation page (although they were slightly outdated with the current api and did contain sql injection problems..).</p>

<p>The only drawback I saw was that there was a hard dependency on the Zend frameworks' Session system. I didn't want to write an adapter for our own platform, so ended up overriding the 'verify' and '_checkId' methods to simply use PHP's built-in $_SESSION array.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that the changes I made to the OpenId_Consumer class only set stuff in the session, but I didn't find anything that actually retrieved those values.</p>

<p>On a completely off-topic note, I just got my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/0596101716/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1219099037&sr=1-1">High Performance MySQL</a>, and I'm pretty excited to read it :)</p>

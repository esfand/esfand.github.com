<p>Escaping user-input in your HTML is essential for preventing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">worlds #1 vulnerability</a>.</p>

<p>When you're embedding user input into javascript, a simple <a href="http://www.php.net/htmlspecialchars">htmlspecialchars</a> won't cut it, you'll need to make sure you're escaping other things, like \n (line endings), and \ (slashes). <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/ArticleXSSInJavaScript">Google doctype</a> has a good list of characters in need of proper escaping to prevent users breaking your javascript.</p>

<p>However, when I dropped the question if a simple string replacement would be good enough, the members of the <a href="http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/">Web security mailing list</a> gave me a different answer.</p>

<p>When escaping or filtering output using a blacklist (such as the one published on google doctype) browser/unicode escaping bugs are not taking into consideration. Some new vulnerability might appear in the future, which would immediately open a hole in your app. For this reason its wiser to go with a much more defensive white-list approach, essentially only letting things through you know is safe.</p>

<h3>Introducing Reform</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Encoding_Project">Reform</a> is a tool that does exactly this. Reform allows you to escape your data for a javascript, xml, html or vbscript (yes it still exists) context. It provides libraries for Java, .NET, PHP, Perl, Python, Javascript and ASP. Pretty cool!</p>

<p>One dislike I have is that it only considers I really small set of unicode codepoints safe, especially when dealing with non-latin languages this is going to add a great deal to the bandwidth usage and the legibility of your sourcecode. One would think there has to be more ranges considered 'safe'.</p>

<p>PHP example:</p>

```php
<?php
  // Assuming the Reform class is included..

  echo '<script type="text/javascript"> var myString = ', Reform::JsString($userInput), '; </script>';

?>
```

<p>I made a couple of changes in the PHP version, specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepended the 'static' keyword to every method to make it work in PHP5's strict mode.</li>
  <li>Removed the UTF-8 checks, I'm in a controlled environment, <a href="http://ca3.php.net/mbstring">mbstring</a> is installed, and the internal encoding is utf-8.</li>
  <li>Added a parameter to Reform::JsString to not automatically put the string between quotes (').</li>
</ul>

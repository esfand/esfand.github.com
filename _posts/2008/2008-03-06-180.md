<p>Random notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For IE7 the focus was on security, IE8 = user experience.</li>
  <li>The IE guy is explaining about how interoperability hurts innovation, because too much time is lost in fixing thise (can't help but getting a big DUH! feeling).</li>
  <li>He explains how there's a lot of content on the web, that depends on the buggy behaviour of older IE versions.. so there's a challenge to solve. IE8 will introduce a compatibility mode, a lot of information with big opionion pieces from both people who like or hate this can be found on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/">A List Apart</a>. Look for version targetting.</li>
  <li>Looks like they created a Firebug-like tool for IE..</li>
</ul>

<h3>HTML 5</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Making the back button work, using HTML5 hash function? Can't actually find any info on this and I think this can be implemented today?</li>
  <li>HTML Connection events .. very cool, javascript can catch an event if the internet connection is gone!</li>
</ul>

<h3>OpenService</h3>

<p>Seems to be about deep browser integration.. Subscribing to Webslices.. Seems to be a mini i-frame integrated into the toolbar.. Examples are shown of facebook status updates and Ebay auctions..</p>

<p>To integrate, add the 'hslice' css class to a div.. If you go to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?">Your facebook homepage, and look at the source, you'll notice there's 'hslice' css classes.</p>

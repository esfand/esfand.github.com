<p>Tomorrow I'll be taking my flight, heading towards <a href="http://visitmix.com/2008/default.aspx">Mix 08</a>.</p>

<p>Should be quite exciting! Even though deep inside it feels like sleeping with the enemy, I should be able to pick up a lot of useful information. As a pure open source developer (haven't touched an MS product in quite some time..), you do get kind of shielded of what is going on on the other side of the fence; getting a new perspective can't hurt.. Not to mention going to Vegas for the first time, hitting the west-coast for the first time and seeing a desert for the first time :).</p>

<p>Oh, and for the Planet-PHP/MXNA readers out there.. I'll definitely let you guys in on what the enemy is up to =). If anyone is heading out there, please do drop me a line so I won't feel all lonely out there.</p>

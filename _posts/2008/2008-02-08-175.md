<p>Today I was sitting at my desk when my cell started ringing.</p>

<p>Really odd, a lady from Red Hat called. After she confirms my name, she asks me if I use the RPM packaging system. Unsuspecting, I answer: "ehh, no.. We're a debian shop..". The lady answers "thank you" and hangs up the phone, leaving me wondering how they got my number, if it was really Red Hat and why she would take the time to call me and ask me this seemingly random question.</p>

<p>Should I be worried?</p>

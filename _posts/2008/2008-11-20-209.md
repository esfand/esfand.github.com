<p>Last night the <a href="http://www.cnma.ca/">CNMA</a> awards were held here in Toronto, and I turned out to go home with an award!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/topener/3043368427/" title="Award by Topener, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/3043368427_7e630b44dd.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Award" /></a></p>

<p>Although I still feel I didn't really deserve such a prize, I feel honored and proud of the <a href="http://www.filemobile.com/">team</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks guys! Its been an amazing ride so far, and also thanks to the CNMA organization and judges.</p>

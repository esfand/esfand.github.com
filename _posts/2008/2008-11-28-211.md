<p>Daniel B. Ravicher from <a href="http://www.pubpat.org/">PUBPAT</a> did a great talk about the patent system and more importantly, how it doesn't work. Worth watching if you are in the tech industry and if you're interested in the subject.</p>

<p>The PUBPAT's mission statement: "PUBPAT Represents the Public's Interests Against
Undeserved Patents and Unsound Patent Policy". Their website could be a bit more glamorous and less dry, but it is an important cause that affects all of us.</p>

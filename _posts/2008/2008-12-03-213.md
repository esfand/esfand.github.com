<p>For some of our long-running processes we use PHP. It makes total sense from our perspective, because we can re-use all our existing business logic from our main PHP web application.</p>

<p>To make things more efficient, I recently started some work on using forks and have a couple of worker processes around.</p>

<p>This application is essentially the core of our transcoder. The parent process would retrieve new jobs from the queue and fire up a number of workers to actually transcode the file. The main problem is that the parent opens up a MySQL connection and fires off some queries. After the child process is done, it actually closes the MySQL connection regardless of if it was actually used or not.</p>

<p>This means I'll have to close all mysql connections before forking, and re-connecting right after. No big deal, but still at least a bit annoying.</p>

```php
<?php

$db = new MySQLi('hostname','user','password');

if (pcntl_fork()) {

    $status = 0;
    // parent
    pcntl_wait($status);

   $result = $db->query('select version()');
   if ($db->error) echo $db->error;

} else {

   // the child process does nothing and exits gracefully

}

?>
```

<p>Output:</p>

```
MySQL server has gone away
```

<p>A few days ago, I came across a situation where I needed to traverse a multi-level directory structure and operate on all the files.</p>

<p>This can be a bit of a tedious job, as you have to deal with either recursion (nice) or a stack (nicer). I had a feeling there might be something in <a href="http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/">SPL</a> to take on this task, so I took a peek and ended up with this gem:</p>

```php
<?php
  $files = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator('.'));

  foreach($files as $file) {

    // Do your stuff here, $file is an SplFileInfo object

  }

?>
```

<h3>So how does this work?</h3>

<p>I'm going to assume you already know what an Iterator is, if not.. search the interweb.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/classDirectoryIterator.html">DirectoryIterator</a> class can be used to traverse directories, much like <a href="http://www.php.net/scandir">scandir()</a> does. The <a href="http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/classRecursiveDirectoryIterator.html">RecursiveDirectoryIterator</a>  works the same way, except it implements the hasChildren() and getChildren() methods. hasChildren returns true if the current item has sub-items (in this case, if the item is a directory) and getChildren will return a new iterator for the current subdirectory.</p>

<p>Using this system, we would still need some recursive function to actually go and loop through each subdirectory, this is where <a href="http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/classRecursiveIteratorIterator.html">RecursiveIteratorIterator</a> comes in. If you pass the RecursiveIteratorIterator any <a href="http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/interfaceRecursiveIterator.html">RecursiveIterator</a> object (like RecursiveDirectoryIterator), it will traverse the entire tree for you and pass you all the leaf-nodes.</p>

<p>The leaf nodes are in this context the files. If you also want to make directories part of the traversal, you can change this by passing the constant RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST as the mode parameter.</p>

```php
<?php
  $files = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator('.'),RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST);
?>
```

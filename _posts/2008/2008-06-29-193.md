Just got a new alpha for this WebDAV library, this version mostly contains bugfixes, and:

* Makes use of [gzuncompress()][1] instead of [gzdecode()][2]
* Support for [Smultron][3] temporary files.
* Now a [pear][4] package and also has a [phing][5] build script.

I found it hard to figure out all non-standard behaviours for the common WebDAV
clients, as there wasn't a lot of information to be found on the net. I
documented all my findings, which could perhaps be of use for other implementors
of the protocol. I'm hoping this will become a good resource for this stuff.

* [OS/X Finder][6]
* [Microsoft Windows (Vista and XP)][7]
* [DavFS/2][8]

The package is still very much alpha state. [Theo][9] reported a segmentation
fault while running the package on OS/X + Apache2 + PHP 5.2.5. My own testing
environment is Debian Etch + Apache 2 + PHP 5.2.0-8+etch11, and I got some
good results there.

<p>Silverlight is a topic I know next to nothing about, but I am seeing some interesting stuff the flash video stack doesn't really have..</p>

<p>They're introducing adaptive streaming.. Allowing videostreams to automatically adjust the bitrate depending on the bandwidth available. Flash has the concept of D-frames, but hardly anyone uses it and generally with less bandwidth you just end up with framedrops..</p>

<p>IIS7 Media pack can be configured to have bitrate throttling, useful for progressive downloads.. This is more an II7 feature than a silverlight feature though..</p>

<p>Thats where it ended, maybe there's more new features but the presentation was short..</p>

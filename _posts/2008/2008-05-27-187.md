<p>This blog is now up for 2 years!</p>

<p>Quite happy with the results so far, its getting tough to always come up with a new post (and have been slacking in the last month a little bit), but by forcing myself to keep this active I've managed to come up with some open source projects, and grow as a person.</p>

<p>Some lame stats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote 54 posts this year, 48 last year; so there's a slight growth =)</li>
  <li>According to awstats there were 12912 uniques in april 2008, versus 6296 uniques in april 2007. The actual number is probably way under that will all the spambots and such; but still happy to know some people read it.</li>
  <li>I've maintained this blog longer than any girlfriend (yes, that's how dedicated I am =P ).</li>
  <li>I've gotten 466 legit comments, and 1525 spam comments that made it through the captcha (thanks so much!).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading and the critique!</p>

<p>A new SabreAMF release is up for grabs at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabreamf/">Google Code site</a>.</p>

<p>This is a bugfix-only release, fixing a few issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The AMF0 and AMF3 serializers did a check with <a href="http://www.php.net/is_numeric">is_numeric</a> to find out if a variable is a number, this would cause problems for numeric-strings, as this function returns true there too. This has been changed to use is_float and is_int.</li>
  <li>There was a bug with the serialization of integers in AMF3 within certain ranges. The algorithm has been fixed by Kevin Martin.. Also, the current implementation is faster. (thanks kevin! get a site, so I can link you..).</li>
  <li>When onGetRemoteClass returns an incorrect value (something else than false or a string) an incorrect exception would be thrown, this is fixed as well.</li>
  <li>Coding standards tid-bits</li>
</ul>

<p>The mysql version currently shipped with Debian-stable (5.0.32) crashes when invoking an <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/insert-delayed.html">INSERT DELAYED</a> on a table that has an AFTER INSERT <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/triggers.html">trigger</a>.</p>

<p>It took me a bit to figure this out, so I wanted to share this for the googlers out there.. When using the <a href="http://www.dotdeb.org/">dotdeb.org</a> version (5.0.45) the problem seems to be resolved. </p>

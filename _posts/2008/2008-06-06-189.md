<p>I killed the sshd daemon from one of our servers by accident today. I wanted to avoid going to the data center, so I was able to upload and run a PHP script to give me a shell..</p>

<p>Problem was, that it would run under the www-data user and trying to su to root gave me the following message:</p>

```
su : must be run from a terminal
```

<p>After some googling, I found the solution from <a href="http://tero.marttila.de/">Tero's glob</a>. If you have python installed, just run the following from your shell:</p>

```
echo "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" > /tmp/asdf.py
python /tmp/asdf.py
```

<p>You now have a proper terminal, and things like 'su' will work as usual.</p>

<p>Last week I heard I was going to a finalist for the <a href="http://www.cnma.ca/">canadian new media awards</a>, in the category 'Best programmer of the year'. While I strongly feel there's way better programmers out there, who just weren't submitted, I am both honored and shocked.</p>

<p>Looks like I'm gonna have to get a suit, which is, as my friend put it, "trying to give a cat a bath". <a href="http://www.filemobile.net/">My company</a> also got nominated in the category 'Most promising company of the year'. Too cool!</p>

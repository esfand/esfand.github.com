I finished a first alpha release for SabreDAV. I'm quite excited, I might add.

Currently it has all the basic tools to create a WebDAV share using PHP, based
on either an existing directory structure on the filesystem, your own custom
virtual folder or a combination of both.

It has been tested using DavFS and the OS/X finder. And it supports all of the
locking features these clients use, making it a fully read-write DAV server.

If you like the idea, please support it by adding it to your [ohloh stack][3].

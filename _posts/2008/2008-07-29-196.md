<p>I got my hands on a file containing OS/X line-endings (\r), which needed to be converted into Unix line-endings (\n).</p>

<p>Normally I would just do a simple search and replace, with:</p>

```
:%s/\r/\n/g
```

<p>Oddly enough, this actually gave me null-characters (0x00) instead of the expected \n. After some browsing, this seems to be the correct command:</p>

```
:%s/\r/\r/g
```

<p>I have no clue why, and this seems wrong to me, as this command should not have any effect (replacing \r with \r). But yea, it worked :S</p>

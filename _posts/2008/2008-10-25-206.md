<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A list apart</a> was probably one of the first feeds I added to my RSS reader, and up until this day I enjoy reading the high quality articles.</p>

<p>Just last Tuesday they published an article around <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/progressiveenhancementwithcss">progressive enhancement with css</a>, which covered a rather funny example from <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/index.php/">Andy Clarke's site</a>, which is completely black and white in IE6, along with modified low-fi images.</p>

<p>I couldn't resist doing this myself as well, so if you hit this site using IE6 now this is how it will look like:</p>

<p><a href="/resources/images/posts/rooftop_ie6.png"><img src="/resources/images/posts/rooftop_ie6.png" alt="IE6!" width="320" /></a>.</p>

<p>The code:</p>

```
<!--[if lte IE 6]>
  <style type="text/css"> body { filter: gray(); } </style>	
<![endif]-->
```

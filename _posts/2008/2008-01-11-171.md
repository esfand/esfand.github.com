<p>HTTP has an incredible useful feature to supply the Content-Type HTTP header for any url. This allows HTTP clients to easily figure out what type of data they're getting.</p>

<p>Over and over again I see clients, not doing this and making assumptions based on the url. The extension of all things! This is some artifact inherited from ms-dos, and passed on to different operation systems when GUI's became popular.</p>

<p>Two clear examples I have today (and I'm sure many people will have examples like this)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flash's <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/fl/video/VideoPlayer.html">VideoPlayer</a> component. If there's no extension in the url, it will assume its some kind of xml file.</li>
  <li>iTunes podcasts.. Files have to end with a known extension for iTunes to pick it up as a video or audio file. Even though the Mime type has to be specified in both the RSS feed and the HTTP Header!</li>
</ul>

<p>WTF?</p>

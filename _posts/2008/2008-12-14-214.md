<p>Like half of the web development community, I recently became really interested in location-enabled stuff ;)</p>

<p>I really want to get a GPS tracker (for christmas!, hint hint!), there seem to be a couple out there, so I'm wondering if there's any people who have such a device and what their experiences are. Ideal features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small! I don't need to display, I just want to drop it in my backpack and forget about it.</li>
  <li>Has USB, all I need is something that spits out cvs data (or similar format) on the drive which I can extract.</li>
  <li>Somewhat good battery life (>24h).</li>
  <li>Most importantly, charges through USB. Batteries is a no-go (for any device for that matter, I'm looking at you wii controller.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So we have some options:</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/NEW-PROFESSIONAL-MINI-TRACKER-KEY/dp/B000H997DA/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1229185848&sr=8-4">Professional mini tracker key</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zPq9fv43L._SL500_AA280_.jpg" /></p>

<p>Pro:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Title of the product is completely written in uppercase, has to mean something right?</li>
  <li>Logs data every second.</li>
</ul>

<p>Con:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses AA batteries.</li>
  <li>No specs on battery life.</li>
  <li>No specs on how to extract the data, but has USB.</li>
  <li>On the expensive side ($278.99).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion so far:</h3>

<p>The Amod AGL3080 seems by a stretch the most impressive device, not only does it seem to have a good battery life, and plenty of storage. Just judging from the page on amazon, it quite frankly seems the most professional, despite it having the lowest price on the list.<p>

<p>Dear lazyweb, am I making a mistake? Are there better devices out there?</p>

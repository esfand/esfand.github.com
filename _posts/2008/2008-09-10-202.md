<p>MySQL allows comments to be added with the standard /* */ syntax. If your application is getting more complex, it can become more difficult to figure out where certain queries originate from.</p>

<p>By simply adding a comment in front of your query, it will be very easy to spot the origin of some of your queries.</p>

```
/* recent blogposts */ SELECT id, title, time FROM blogposts ORDER BY time DESC limit 10
```

<p>The comment will show up as the first thing in SHOW [FULL] PROCESSLIST, MySQL administrator and your log/slow-log files.</p>

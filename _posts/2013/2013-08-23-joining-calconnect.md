I got the news this week that I'll be representing [fruux][1] as an official
member of [CalConnect][2].

CalConnect is the "Calendar and Scheduling Consortium" and among other things,
they are responsible for writing up the IETF standards (the ones with the RFC
numbers) related to things like CalDAV, CardDAV, vCard, iCalendar and so on.

I'm excited to be a part of this, and to have our company listed among the
[big names][3], pretty much covering every company doing something relevant to
calendaring on the web.

With a little luck I'll even be able to fulfil my life-long dream of having my
name immortalized in a list of authors of the ietf rfc's ;).

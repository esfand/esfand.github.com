You may lament the fact that it's silly that both Firefox and Chrome support
more of Microsoft's operating system, than they do themselves.

Or that it's bad design that their browser is so deeply engrained in the
system that it's very hard to run more than 1 version in paralel, but at the
very least the beast from redmond is trying to improve the situation for
web developers such as you and I.

Since about a year Microsoft launched [modern.ie][1]. On this website they
host virtual machines for every internet explorer + windows combination.

Separate appliances are provided for [VMWare Fusion][2], [Parallels][3] and
the open source [VirtualBox][4].

Best of all, it's free.

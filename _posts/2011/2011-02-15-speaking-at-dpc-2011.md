<p>A bit ago I received the news I'll be a speaker at the <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl/">Dutch PHP conference</a>. My talk is titled 'So you think you know REST'. Most of you seem to have a general idea what 'REST' and being 'RESTful' means, but often times there are misconceptions.</p>

<p>REST is called an 'architectural style', which means there's not one specification or standard you can work off. So most of the talk will really cover the pitfalls and best practices of applying RESTful principals in the context of HTTP.</p>

<p>I've done a much longer version of this talk before, so my biggest challenge is in compressing it into a really interesting 45 minute talk :).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl/schedule/">DPC schedule</a> looks very exciting, and I know I am :) I hope you can make it too!</p>

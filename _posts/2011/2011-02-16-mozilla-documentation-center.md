<p>In case you're still using w3schools are a reference (which <a href="http://w3fools.com/">according to some</a> is harmful to the web), a few new references have recently popped up from the browser vendors.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/web">Mozilla Document Center</a> is by a stretch my favourite. It's a rapidly growing wiki-based documentation and more often than not it will have what you need. The HTML, CSS and Javascript documentation is really excellent, and going there directly often beats googling.</p>

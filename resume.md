Evert Pot
=========

_Web architect, API developer_

* Last update: *October 2nd, 2015*.
* Location: Toronto, ON, Canada.
* Contact: <mailto:work@evertpot.com>.


Summary
-------

My name is Evert, and I've been a Web Developer for over 10 years. I've been
doing consulting for a wide range of companies, from small businesses to
telcos, financial services and national broadcasters.

I'm especially interested in API design, implementing better engineering
practices, scalability problems and application architecture. In the past I've
had a strong focus on PHP, but I'm very open to other technology stacks as
well.

I'm currently looking for projects! In particular:

* Short and long term projects.
* Can work hourly or on project-basis.
* I can work on-site in Toronto, remotely anywhere and I would also be
  thrilled to fly to you for a week or two to kick off a new project.

I am specifically _not_ looking for full or part-time employment.

Experience
----------

### Co-Founder/CTO fruux, Germany + UK — 2011 - 2015

In December 2011 I went full-time with fruux, which was a bit of a
side-project at the time. We got a seed investment round, and opened the
door to our office. As the technical lead I’ve been responsible for the
technical and product direction, as well as leading the team from a
technical perspective. Aside from that I’ve also got my hands dirty in some
marketing and sales, and basically just stepped in where needed.

### Consulting, worldwide — 2003-today

I’ve been doing this ‘full-time’ on and off, whenever I’ve not really been
fully focused on a job. I’ve had the opportunity to work in
telecommunication, social media, group ware, advertising, broadcasting,
financial service companies in Australia, Portugal, Canada and The
Netherlands, and remotely worked for various other companies from North
America, Europe and Asia.


### Software engineer, Ibuildings, Utrecht, Netherlands — 2010-2011

In 2010 I started working for Ibuildings in the Netherlands as a senior
software engineer. Ibuildings is a software development company based in
The Netherlands and London, UK specializing in PHP and other web-related
technologies.
My role was primarily in leading development teams, training and development.
I’ve worked here on scalability issues for nu.nl (the number one Dutch news
site), designed Javascript/YUI3 based ‘fat’ javascript clients, (RESTful)
Web-service development and in-house training around subjects such as
web-services design, and a full-day javascript workshop.

### Lead architect/owner, Filemobile, Toronto, Canada — 2006-2014

After working with Filemobile as a contractor, I took on the job as lead
architect. Being the first person on the payroll, I was given the task of
making both the application and business scalable by hiring and managing new
engineers and putting development processes in place. For Filemobile, I
developed a scalable social network and user-generated content whitelabel
engine, working with Canada’s leading media brands such as CBC, CTV, Fox, TSN,
CP24.

In this job I worked with PHP, complicated multi-master, MySQL setups (with
geographic redundancy), Memcached, Amazon S3 and EC2 and I was responsible
for developing a multi-core, multi-machine transcoding engine as well as
leading the development team.
Starting August 2009 I resigned as lead architect to continue my work as
independent consultant, after that I was still involved as in an advisory role
and owner.

In late 2015 the company was sold to NewZulu, an Australian-based media
company.

### Senior Web developer/partner, Collab, Utrecht, the Netherlands — 2004-2006

Together with Collab I’ve got a taste of many experimental innovative software,
such as real-time, multi-user rich internet applications including web video
chat and media conversion. Using technologies such as Flash Communication
Server (now Flash Media Server) and FFMpeg. In these 3 years I’ve worked with
Dutch media and internet companies, such as NOS, BNN, Telegraaf/Speurders.nl,
EasyConcepts, Netmasters and UDC/Dancevalley.

### Application developer/Sys admin, V/d Veer, Surhuisterveen, The Netherlands — 2003

Developed and implemented a car inventory and lease database. The Database was
based on Interbase, the front-end was built using Borland Delphi. I got this
job as an intern, and I was forced to jump in and learn many technologies that
were new for me at the time, such as SQL.

### Junior sys admin/Tech support, Microdesk, Rijswijk, The Netherlands — 2001

This job involved many system administrator tasks, such as working with
hardware, installing and preparing massive amounts of desktop machines and
occasionally getting coffee for the more senior people in the company.

Other projects

### Blogging

I've been blogging on and off since 2006. Here's some of my favourites:

<ul>
{% for post in site.tags.featured %}
  <li>
     <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
     <span>({{ post.date | date:"%Y-%m-%d" }})</span>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Because of this, I've been published in both PHP Architect (a paper PHP
magazine), and PHP Advent (now defunct series of articles).

### sabre.io

Since 2007 I started working on an open source library that would be named
sabre/dav. This project spawned a number of PHP libraries that are now widely
in use for various purposes. The project site is <http://sabre.io/>. I'm still
the lead maintainer for all of these projects.
